        "ai_answer": "I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo find the derivative of x^2, we can use the power rule of differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, we have f(x) = x^2, so n = 2. Therefore, using the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 2x^(2-1)\n= 2x^1\n= 2x\n\nSo, the derivative of x^2 with respect to x is indeed 2x.",
